# About FECS

The **Fencing Equipment Check System (FECS)** revolutionizes how fencing tournaments manage equipment verification. Born from the real-world challenges faced by tournament organizers and fencers alike, FECS streamlines the entire equipment check process.

## Our Mission

We believe that technology should enhance the sport we love, not complicate it. FECS eliminates the chaos of traditional equipment checks, replacing paper-based systems with a modern, efficient digital solution.

<Callout type="info">
**Did you know?** Traditional equipment checks can take up to 30% of tournament preparation time. FECS reduces this to just minutes.
</Callout>

## Why FECS Exists

Every fencer knows the frustration: long queues at equipment check, lost paperwork, unclear status updates, and the anxiety of not knowing if your gear will pass inspection. Tournament organizers face their own challenges: managing multiple check stations, tracking hundreds of pieces of equipment, and ensuring fair, consistent verification.
